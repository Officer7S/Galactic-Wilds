# Procedural Planet Generation - Lite Samples Pack

Thank you for downloading this asset!

This is a free, lightweight version of the Procedural Planet Generation framework: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/vfx/shaders/procedural-planet-generation-339842

## Important Upgrade Notice:
This asset was formerly known as Procedural Celestial Body Materials. It has been rebranded and updated to be a samples pack for the full Procedural Planet Generation asset.

Any previous installations of this asset must be deleted before upgrading to avoid conflicts.
- The 2.1.2 version can still be imported optionally as a zipped .unitypackage. You can choose to import this file manually if you wish to use the older version.

## Sample Scenes
You can find two sample scenes in the Samples folder:

1. Planets Sample Scene - shows 12 different procedurally generated celestial bodies - stars, planets, moons and gas giants with rings. You can randomize or edit the bodies in the editor through the custom inspector buttons or manually modify the shader properties.
2. Runtime Generation Sample Scene - shows a simple setup for runtime generation. Enter Play mode and use the UI to generate variants of the celestial bodies.
